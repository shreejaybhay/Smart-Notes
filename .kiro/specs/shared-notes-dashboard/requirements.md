## Introduction

The Shared Notes Dashboard feature provides a centralized interface for users to manage all note sharing activities within the SmartNotes application. This feature enables users to view and manage notes shared with them by others, as well as notes they have shared with teammates. The dashboard serves as the single source of truth for all sharing-related activities, including pending invitations, active collaborations, permission management, and link sharing.
